# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

	1) My final project idea is to make a Pokedex. I envision that it will ask the user to 
	input a number (1 to 51 minimum or 151 maximum) then it will display the information 
	of the corresponding pokemon according the the gen 1 list. The information displayed
	would be: name, typing, average height, average weight, and possible genders. More
	information can be added if need be.

	2) Another final idea is that just like the first idea, the user would enter 2 different 
	names and the program will give some information about them and it would also who would 
	most likely win via pokemon typing

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

	Sofia Cordero and Nazli Iclal

## Do you have any questions of your own?

	The only question I have is about how much information would be enough for a 3 person 
	group.
